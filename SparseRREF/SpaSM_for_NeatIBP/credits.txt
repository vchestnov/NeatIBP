This is a SpaSM version made for NeatIBP only.

To solve the problem of installation, we changed the file bench/Makefile.am and added bench/modules.c in this version.

All the changes will not do harm to the SpaSM package itself and it works well.

All the credits of SpaSM goes to Dr. Charles Bouillaguet, Sorbonne Universit√© and we have the permission to include this package into NeatIBP.

This package follows GPL-3.0 license.
