[NeatIBP 1.0.0.0]
This is the earliest release version.

[NeatIBP 1.0.0.1]
Date: 2023.2.6
Modifications:
	1. Fixed known bugs.
	2. Added CheckIBP.wl

[NeatIBP 1.0.0.2]
Date: 2023.4.7
Modifications:
	1. Fixed known bugs.
	2. Some usage improvements.
	3. Added a step to remove all FIBPs that concernes no integrals in the current sector seeded by the highest denominator type.
	4. Supporting seeding via FIBP Functions. This will make the seeding faster than seeding via replacement.
	
[NeatIBP 1.0.0.3]
Date: 2023.4.10
Modifications:
	1. Fixed known bugs.
	2. Reimplemented seeding via FIBP Functions, modified to seeding via nFIBP Functions.
	3. Added memory used report.
	
[NeatIBP 1.0.0.4]
Date: 2023.4.11
Modifications:
	1. Allow the usage of Mathematica Sow-and-Reap method in Zurich seeding.
	2. Allow the usage of ParallelTable when finding symmetry maps between sectors. 
	
[NeatIBP 1.0.1.0]
Date: 2023.4.12
Modifications:
	1. Added Azuritino in NeatIBP to find master integrals.
	2. Some refinement modifications.

[NeatIBP 1.0.1.1]
Date: 2023.4.13
Modifications:
	1. Some fixings and useful improvements.
	2. Allow the user to input the finite field modulus.
	3. Allow the user to input the degree bounds in azuritino and the main body of NeatIBP.
	4. Allow user to determine whether singular temporary files should be deleted once they are used. Yes by default.
	5. Introducing more parallel evaluations in CheckIBP.wl.
