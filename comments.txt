What if one AnalyzeSectors failed unexpectedly? The system will consider this sector still computing, eternally.

[SyzygyRed.wl]
There are some global variables named "m" or "z" etc. in the code. 
  They`d better be changed to some longer names, to avoid possible \
contradiction with user`s code. (Like Litered`s "j").
  But considering we will use this in commandLine, this is not that \
important
 No, it is important if user defines some kinematic variables like m[1]...

Some parameters need to be made optional, eg. degree bound

SDim seems unecessary in the code, try get rid of it?

The IntegralOrder is a global variable... not so good, we would be better set a default value of it. 


issue in the dev_log.txt at 2022.0923 [II] needs to be improved.

Generate nFIBPs is slow because of CoefficientRules, I do not know the way to improve it.
Zurich seeding step for high degree seeds is slow, which is due to Replacements in function IntegralRealization. Also, no idea for improvements for now.

Need to consider a situation: what if a worker quits unexpectedly? The current system will not discover this and it would think the worker is still working.

RelavantIntegrals is useless... We do not need to export them.

Copy right of SPASM

Consider a question: Can user compute 2 or more different projects at the same time?

Clean up useless trashes!

in dev_log there is a issue at 2022.11.14:
Added outputPath=Automatic. We need to test what if it is not Automatic

in MissionStatusChecker.wl, the first code block, ......=Infinity, I do not know why...
