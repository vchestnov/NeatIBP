==========Urgent===================


Need to consider a situation: what if a AnalyzeSectors.wl process quits unexpectedly? The current system will not discover this and it would think the worker is still working.

Copy right of SPASM

issue in the dev_log.txt at 2022.0923 [II] needs to be improved.


==========Important=================


[SyzygyRed.wl]
There are some global variables named "m" or "z" etc. in the code. 
  They`d better be changed to some longer names, to avoid possible \
contradiction with user`s code. (Like Litered`s "j").
  But considering we will use this in commandLine, this is not that \
important
 No, it is important if user defines some kinematic variables like m[1]...

Some parameters need to be made optional, eg. degree bound

SDim seems unecessary in the code, try get rid of it?

The IntegralOrder is a global variable... not so good, we would be better set a default value of it. 





RelavantIntegrals is useless... We do not need to export them.


Consider a question: Can user compute 2 or more different projects at the same time?

Clean up useless trashes!



=============Not Important=================
why do we need to set TemporaryDirectory everywhere?

Generate nFIBPs is slow because of CoefficientRules, I do not know the way to improve it.
Zurich seeding step for high degree seeds is slow, which is due to Replacements in function IntegralRealization. Also, no idea for improvements for now.

in MissionStatusChecker.wl, the first code block, ......=Infinity, I do not know why...

what does "mapped sectors" mean? the naming in the codes are confusing. the concept "mapped and sub sectors" is not accurate. it should be "image or sub sectors."
